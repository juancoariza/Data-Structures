# Data-Structures
A repository of all the files created for my Data Structures and Algorithms class, Spring 2019. 
Files found within focus on creating the data structures "from scratch" - that is, using the algorithms to create the structures, rather than using the existing implementations included in the Java *Software Development Kit (SDK)*.

The following Structures are implemented: Lists, Trees, Queues, Stacks, etc.

**Stacks**
Stacks are implemented using an Array of fixed size, following the First-In, Last-Out (FILO) implementation native to a stack.
The implemented methods include:
- Push: adds an Object element to the top of the stack
- Pop: removes the Object element from the top of the stack
- Peek: obtains the information of element below current stack top
